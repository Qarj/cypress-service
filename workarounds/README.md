# Workaround - assets

Mochawesome sometimes forgets to generate the assets folder when generating a report so we need to do it manually.

The assets folder should exist in the same path where `mochawesome.html` is located, for example

```
cypress-service/results/local/members-area-ui/2021.07.29/16.11.11.754_deploy_0.0.293/suite-canary/assets
```
